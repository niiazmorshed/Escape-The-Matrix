# 🚫 Prevent Teachers & Admins from Enrolling in Courses

## ✅ **Problem Fixed:**

### **Issue:**

Teachers and admins were able to click the "Enroll" button on courses in the "All Classes" page, which doesn't make sense since:

- Teachers are instructors, not students
- Admins have administrative access
- Enrollment is meant for students only

### **Solution:**

Implemented role-based enrollment prevention that:

1. Checks if user is a teacher or admin
2. Shows a different button with clear messaging
3. Displays a toast notification if they try to enroll
4. Prevents the enrollment API call from being made

---

## 🔄 **What Changed:**

### **Before:**

```jsx
// All users saw the same "Enroll Now" button
<button onClick={handleEnroll}>Enroll Now</button>
```

**Result:**

- ❌ Teachers could click "Enroll Now"
- ❌ Admins could click "Enroll Now"
- ❌ No clear indication that teachers shouldn't enroll

### **After:**

```jsx
// Different buttons based on role
{
  isTeacher || isAdmin ? (
    <button onClick={handleEnroll}>🚫 Teachers Can't Enroll</button>
  ) : (
    <button onClick={handleEnroll}>Enroll Now</button>
  );
}
```

**Result:**

- ✅ Teachers see "Teachers Can't Enroll" button
- ✅ Admins see "Admins Can't Enroll" button
- ✅ Toast notification when clicked
- ✅ Students see normal "Enroll Now" button

## 👥 **Button Appearance by Role:**

### **Student View:**

│                                  │
│  [ 🚫 Admins Can't Enroll ]     │
│         ← Gray/Disabled          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

✅ Clear indication that enrollment is not allowed

---

## 🔔 **Toast Notification:**

### **When Teacher Clicks:**

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🚫 Teachers and admins cannot enroll in      │
│    courses as students                        │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Toast Configuration:**

```jsx
toast.error("Teachers and admins cannot enroll in courses as students", {
  icon: "🚫",
  duration: 4000, // Shows for 4 seconds
});
```

---

## 💻 **Implementation Details:**

### **1. Import Required Hooks:**

```jsx
import useTeacher from "../../Hooks/useTeacher";
import useAdmin from "../../Hooks/useAdmin";

const EnrollButton = ({ courseId, onEnrolled }) => {
  const [isTeacher] = useTeacher();
  const [isAdmin] = useAdmin();
  // ... rest of code
};
```

### **2. Check Role Before Enrollment:**

```jsx
const handleEnroll = async () => {
  if (!user?.email) {
    toast.error("Please login to enroll in courses");
    return;
  }

  // Prevent teachers and admins from enrolling
  if (isTeacher || isAdmin) {
    toast.error("Teachers and admins cannot enroll in courses as students", {
      icon: "🚫",
      duration: 4000,
    });
    return; // Stop execution - don't make API call
  }

  // Continue with enrollment for students
  setPosting(true);
  // ... enrollment logic
};
```

### **3. Show Different Button UI:**

```jsx
// Show different button for teachers/admins
if (isTeacher || isAdmin) {
  return (
    <button
      className="btn bg-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-500 text-white border-none cursor-not-allowed"
      onClick={handleEnroll}
    >
      <svg>{/* Prohibition icon */}</svg>
      {isTeacher ? "Teachers Can't Enroll" : "Admins Can't Enroll"}
    </button>
  );
}

// Normal button for students
return <button onClick={handleEnroll}>Enroll Now</button>;
```

---

## 🎨 **Button Styling:**

### **Student Button (Active):**

```css
className="btn bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white border-none"
```

- Blue color → Inviting, clickable
- Hover effect → Interactive feedback

### **Teacher/Admin Button (Disabled):**

```css
className="btn bg-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-500 text-white border-none cursor-not-allowed"
```

- Gray color → Indicates disabled/unavailable
- `cursor-not-allowed` → Shows ⛔ cursor on hover
- Still clickable to show toast message

---

## 🔍 **Logic Flow:**

### **Teacher Tries to Enroll:**

```
Teacher views All Classes page
    ↓
Sees course card with gray button
    ↓
Button shows "Teachers Can't Enroll" 🚫
    ↓
Teacher clicks button (curious or by mistake)
    ↓
Toast notification appears:
"Teachers and admins cannot enroll in courses as students"
    ↓
No API call is made
    ↓
Button remains gray and disabled
```

### **Student Enrolls Normally:**

```
Student views All Classes page
    ↓
Sees course card with blue "Enroll Now" button
    ↓
Student clicks button
    ↓
API call: POST /enroll with courseId
    ↓
Success response
    ↓
Toast: "Enrolled successfully!" ✅
    ↓
Button changes to "Already Enrolled" (green)
```

## 🛡️ **Security Layers:**

### **Layer 1: UI Prevention (Frontend)**

```jsx
// Show different button
if (isTeacher || isAdmin) {
  return <button>Teachers Can't Enroll</button>;
}
```

- Visual indication
- User-friendly message

### **Layer 2: Function-Level Check**

```jsx
if (isTeacher || isAdmin) {
  toast.error("Cannot enroll");
  return; // Stop execution
}
```

- Prevents API call
- Shows clear message

### **Layer 3: Backend Validation (Recommended)**

```js
// Backend: /enroll endpoint
app.post("/enroll", verifyToken, async (req, res) => {
  const user = req.user;

  // Check user role
  if (user.role === "teacher" || user.role === "admin") {
    return res.status(403).json({
      success: false,
      message: "Teachers and admins cannot enroll in courses",
    });
  }

  // Process enrollment for students
});
```

- Final security check
- Prevents direct API manipulation

## 🔑 **Key Points:**

### **Role Detection:**

const [isAdmin] = useAdmin(); // true if user is admin
```

if (isTeacher || isAdmin) {
  toast.error("Cannot enroll as teacher/admin");
  return; // Stop function execution
}
```

```jsx
className = "btn bg-gray-400 ... cursor-not-allowed";
