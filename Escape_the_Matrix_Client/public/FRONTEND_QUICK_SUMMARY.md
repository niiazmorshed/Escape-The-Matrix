# Frontend Assessment System - Quick Summary

## 🎯 What Changed

We now have a **separate SubmissionsCollection** in the database that stores all student submissions (assignments, quizzes, discussions).

---

## 📋 For Frontend Developers

### New Database Collection: SubmissionsCollection

**All student submissions** (assignments, quizzes, discussions) are now stored in `SubmissionsCollection` instead of being embedded in assessments.

## 🔌 Key API Endpoints

### For Students:

## 🎨 Teacher Grading Interface

### What to Build:

A page that shows:

1. **All enrolled students** in the class
2. **Who submitted** the assessment
3. **Who didn't submit**
4. **Easy grading** interface

### How It Works:

```javascript
// Step 1: Fetch enrolled students
GET /class-enrollments/:classId
→ Returns: [{ studentEmail, studentId, enrolledDate }]

// Step 2: Fetch submissions for the assessment
GET /api/teacher/assessment/:assessmentId/submissions
→ Returns: [{ studentEmail, studentName, submittedAt, fileUrl, status, grade }]

// Step 3: Merge data
const gradingData = enrolledStudents.map(student => {
  const submission = submissions.find(s => s.studentEmail === student.studentEmail);
  return {
    studentEmail: student.studentEmail,
    hasSubmitted: !!submission,
    submission: submission || null,
    status: submission?.status || 'not-submitted'
  };
});

// Step 4: Display in table
```

### Display Format:

| Student Name | Email            | Status           | Submitted At  | Late?     | Grade | Actions   |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | --------- | ----- | --------- |
| John Doe     | john@example.com | ✅ Graded        | Oct 15, 10:30 | ✓ On Time | 95    | View      |
| Jane Smith   | jane@example.com | 📝 Submitted     | Oct 15, 09:00 | ⚠️ Late   | -     | **Grade** |
| Bob Wilson   | bob@example.com  | ❌ Not Submitted | -             | -         | -     | -         |

### Grading Modal:

When teacher clicks "Grade" button:

```javascript
// Show modal with:
- Student name
- Submission text (if any)
- File download link: /uploads/submissions/filename.pdf
- Grading form:
  * Grade input (0-100)
  * Feedback textarea
  * Submit button

// On submit:
PUT /api/teacher/grade-submission
Body: {
  submissionId: "...",
  grade: 85,
  feedback: "Great work!"
}
```

## 📁 File Uploads

### Path Changed:

- **OLD:** `/uploads/assessments/`
- **NEW:** `/uploads/submissions/`

### Download Files:

```javascript
<a href={`http://localhost:5000${submission.fileUrl}`} download>
  Download: {submission.fileName}
</a>
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Implementation

### 1. Student View (Already Working)

```javascript
// Fetch assessments with submission status
const { data } = await axios.get(`/api/student/class/${classId}/assessments`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});

// Each assessment shows:
data.forEach((assessment) => {
  console.log(assessment.mySubmissions); // Array of submissions
  console.log(assessment.submissionCount); // How many submitted
});
```

### 2. Teacher Grading View (TO BUILD)

```javascript
// TeacherGradingPage.jsx
const TeacherGradingPage = () => {
  const [gradingData, setGradingData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      // 1. Get enrolled students
      const students = await axios.get(`/class-enrollments/${classId}`);

      // 2. Get submissions
      const submissions = await axios.get(
        `/api/teacher/assessment/${assessmentId}/submissions`
      );

      // 3. Merge: Match students with submissions
      const merged = students.data.map((student) => ({
        ...student,
        submission: submissions.data.data.find(
          (s) => s.studentEmail === student.studentEmail
        ),
        hasSubmitted: !!submissions.data.data.find(
          (s) => s.studentEmail === student.studentEmail
        ),
      }));

      setGradingData(merged);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <table>
      {gradingData.map((student) => (
        <tr>
          <td>{student.studentEmail}</td>
          <td>{student.hasSubmitted ? "✅ Submitted" : "❌ Not Submitted"}</td>
          <td>
            {student.submission && (
              <button onClick={() => gradeSubmission(student.submission)}>
                Grade
              </button>
            )}
          </td>
        </tr>
      ))}
    </table>
  );
};
```
