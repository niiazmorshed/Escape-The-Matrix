## 🔌 Backend Connection

The frontend connects to these backend endpoints:

```javascript
// Get all student assessments
GET /api/student/dashboard/assessments

// Get assessment details
GET /api/student/assessment/:assessmentId

// Submit assignment
POST /api/student/submit-assignment

// Submit quiz
POST /api/student/submit-quiz

// Submit discussion
POST /api/student/submit-discussion
```

All endpoints are already implemented in your backend (see `public/ASSESSMENT_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`)

---

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Step 1: Backend Setup (Required)

Make sure your backend server is running with the assessment system:

```bash
# Start backend server
cd /path/to/backend
node index.js
```

Confirm you see the assessment endpoints in your server logs.

### Step 2: Create Sample Assessment (Using Backend)

Teachers can create assessments via the backend API. Here's a quick test:

```bash
# Get JWT token
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/jwt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"teacher@example.com"}'

# Create a sample assignment (replace TOKEN and CLASS_ID)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/teacher/class/YOUR_CLASS_ID/assessment \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "assignment",
    "title": "Week 1 Assignment - React Components",
    "description": "Build a React component library",
    "instructions": "Follow the guidelines in the attached PDF",
    "dueDate": "2025-10-25T23:59:59Z",
    "totalPoints": 100,
    "passingScore": 70,
    "allowLateSubmission": false,
    "content": {
      "submissionType": "both",
      "allowedFileTypes": [".pdf", ".doc", ".docx"]
    },
    "status": "draft"
  }'

# Publish the assessment
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/teacher/assessment/ASSESSMENT_ID/publish \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Step 3: View as Student

1. **Login as a student** who is enrolled in the class
2. **Go to Dashboard → My Assessments**
3. **You should see the assessment** in the pending section!
4. **Click on it** to view details
5. **Submit** the assignment with text or file

### Step 4: Check Results

- Assignments: Wait for teacher to grade
- Quizzes: **Instant results with auto-grading!**
- Discussions: Submitted successfully

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Test Now (Recommended)

1. Start your backend server
2. Login as a student
3. Navigate to `/dashboard/myassessments`
4. See if assessments appear (teacher must create them first)

### Option 2: Create Teacher UI (Optional)

- Create forms for teachers to create assessments
- Add grading interface for teachers
- View submission statistics
- (Not included in current implementation)

### Option 3: Test with Backend API Directly

- Use the cURL commands above to create assessments
- Then view them as a student in the frontend

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Enrollment Required:** Students must be enrolled in a class to see its assessments
2. **Published Only:** Only published assessments (status: "published") are visible to students
3. **Auto-Grading:** Quizzes are graded instantly - no teacher action needed!
4. **File Upload:** Make sure `uploads/assessments/` directory exists on your backend
5. **JWT Tokens:** All API calls require authentication via JWT

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No Assessments Yet"

- Check if student is enrolled in any classes
- Check if teacher has created and published assessments
- Check backend console for errors

### "Failed to Load Assessment"

- Check if backend server is running
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify JWT token is valid

### File Upload Fails

- Check file type (must be PDF, DOC, or DOCX)
- Check file size (must be < 10MB)
- Check `uploads/assessments/` directory exists on backend

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

✅ Students can navigate to `/dashboard/myassessments`  
✅ They see a list of assessments from their enrolled classes  
✅ They can click and view assessment details  
✅ They can submit assignments with files  
✅ They can take quizzes and see instant results  
✅ Grades appear after teacher grades assignments
